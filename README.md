## Executive Summary:
Using Excel, SQL & PowerBI, I clean, process, and visualize the Telecom Company employee data. After identifying the relationship between variables that affect the gender diversity of the company, I provide recommendations to improve the gender balance at the Telecom Company.
## Business Problem:
The HR at the telecom client of PwC is not seeing any progress in gender diversity and inclusion despite working hard to improve it. What are the causes of this problem? How can the telecom client improve gender diversity and inclusion?
## Methodology:
1.	Clean the data on Excel before importing it on MySQL Workbench. 
2.	Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis with MySQL to extract and understand the data.
3.	Calculate measures and determine the Key Performance Indicators.
4.	Build a PowerBI dashboard to visualize the relationship and nature of KPIs. 
5.	Make observations on the KPIs to recommend effective strategies that improve the gender balance.
## Skills:
Excel: Data Manipulation, Cell Formatting, Data Sorting & Filtering
SQL: Aggregate Functions, Joins
Power BI: ETL, writing functions, data visualization, data modeling
## Results and Business Recommendations:
This visualization enables us to draw several conclusions:
1.	The percentage of hired women is maximum at the junior-level positions and declines at higher executive levels.
2.	The percentage of women in executive levels is 16%.
3.	The average performance rating for women is higher than the average performance rating for men.
4.	The wait time for promotion is maximum for women who are junior officers and senior officers.
5.	The average performance rating for these positions for women is 2.5 (above average).
## Next Steps:
1.	Increasing the representation of women in higher positions 
2.	Introducing mentorship programs to catalyze the progress of women into higher positions.
3.	Investigating the reasons behind the high wait times for women with above average performance ratings.
